# A Discord bot built from scratch, using Discord.js

(You are not able to simply clone this repo and start the bot. There are a bunch of parts missing, that i am not able to upload.)

This is a Bot for the VoIP app "Discord", i built it from ground up myself, in order to learn Javascript and Node.js

The bot currently has around 5-6k written lines and ~40 Commands, some of which are pretty unique!

It doesnt really have a set direction for the bot, as i'm only using it to learn, because of this alot of functions can seem random.

Some of them include:
- Leveling and XP (in order to learn Databases)
- Picture Searching from Imgur (in order to learn integration of API's)
- A Fight command, that turns discord into a Turnbased-Strategy Game! (To test my limits of optimization and scaling)
- A Visual interface (in order to learn integration of more complex libraries, in this case "Qode" and "NodeGUI")
- A Play command, for playing Music from Youtube (More in-depth API integration and learning of Audio-codecs)

If you have any Questions or want to see the bot in action, simply hit me up on Discord: Finalboss Tom#5844
