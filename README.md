# A Discord bot built from scratch, using Discord.js

(You are not able to simply clone this repo and start the bot. There are a bunch of parts missing, that i am not able to upload.)

This is currently my biggest and most time consuming project yet.
I am building a Discord bot with Node.js and Discord.js in order to learn Javascript by myself.

The bot currently has around 5-6k written lines and ~40 Commands, some of which are pretty unique!

I don't really have a set direction for the bot at the moment, as i'm only using it to learn, because of this
it has alot of seemingly random functions.

Some of them include:
- Leveling and XP (in order to learn Databases)
- Picture Searching from Imgur (in order to learn integration of API's)
- A Fight command, that turns discord into a Turnbased-Strategy Game! (To test my limits of optimization and scaling)
- A Visual interface (in order to learn integration of more complex libraries, in this case "Qode" and "NodeGUI")
- A Play command, for playing Music from Youtube (More in-depth API integration and learning of Audio-codecs)
- (Upcoming) A interactive Worldmap that allows for traveling (in order to understand Vector-Math and Pathfinding)

I currently also accept alot of requests, just to see how good i'm able to handle different scenarios, so some of the commands
the bot is able to use, are from these said requests. They sometimes maybe won't make the most sense, but as long as i'm learning
i'm fine with that.

Feel free to hit me up, if you have any questions!
